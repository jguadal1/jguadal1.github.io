Ex Macihna is one of those movies that, from the inception of it's opening scene to *insert ending here*, left me curious and a bit inspired.. and a bit melancholy when it ended. Of course, after watching it once I proceeded to spam the movie over the course of weeks and months until my grand epiphany and possibly haphazrd decision of joining Flatiron. Nothing to motivate you to join a coding bootcamp like watching a slightly sociopathic genius of a man laboring on his life's magnum opus(a.k.a: "Frankenstein") in the middle of Norway.

But the thing is that it wasn't just watching a hermit play with robots that motivated me, but, like the variables i will be working with, it was just one part of an ever-expanding data set. The tinder was already set in place before the strike of the match. You could think of it like this: The movie was the final strike of the match to light the bundle of sticks already there. The bundle of sticks being the combiantion of various events in my life along with my natural wiring as a human being. All as if it were programmed to logically work out that way. And all of this a variable in a much larger and over-arching data set.

I make it sound as though there is some being stroking the keys of a keyboard to print out what is my life. Truth be told, I do believe something kind of like that. But I digress. "Why did you decide to learn data science?" I believe is the question. Ultimately, I decided to learn data science because I'm curious and want to make money being curious.
